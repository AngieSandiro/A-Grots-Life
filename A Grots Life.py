# Class defines an object

#self represents the instance of the class.
#When objects are instantiated, the object itself is passed into the self parameter.
#Because of this, the objectâ€™s data is bound to the object

# __init__ ( known as a constructor or initialization method)
# This automatically invoked when new object is created.
# All class will have a method __init__ which provide instructions on what arguments is needed
# eg: gob = Goblin(gob_name,0,100,0,20) which is the goblin's name,hunger,health,provision,gold
# can invoke functions/methods but in this case just intialize attribute values 

# In python 3 it makes little difference if it is class Goblin: or Goblin (object) or Globin():  
# since in python 3 it inherits it behind the scence anyway so 'Goblin:' would be fine
#Left it in the code just to make you aware if you ever see (object), took me awhile to research.
